      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>When is the last time you took a break from your busy life, stepped out into nature, and just relished in the beauty of the world around you? If that’s the kind of thing you’re looking to do, I’ve got the solution for you! As a big fan of hiking myself, especially as a meditative opportunity, I want to make a website for the purpose of supplying other adventurous people with the information they need to have great new experiences in the form of hiking. Idaho has many great hiking trails, and my website will make it simple for Idahoans or visitors to the state to find popular trails for the sake of a new relaxing trek away from their everyday concerns. It will also offer tips to new hikers on how to best prepare for the trail so they can have the most enjoyable, stress-free adventure possible!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is for anyone living in or visiting Idaho who has an interest in hiking. Whether that is someone who is already an avid hiker and looking for another great hike, or someone who is new to hiking and wants to try it out for the first time. This website will also contain information on what every hiker needs, so the audience is anyone at any skill level who wants a new adventure in nature.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Trails</h3>
      <p>
        <p><strong>Tubbs Hill Trail</strong></p>
        <p>Tubbs Hill is a nice and short 2 mile hike in Coeur d&rsquo;Alene. Great for beginners or those just looking for a simple, pretty hike. It typically takes less than an hour, and it loops around back to where you started so there&rsquo;s no backtracking, making each sight a new one!</p>
        <p><strong>Table Rock</strong></p>
        <p>This hike in Boise is only slightly more difficult than Tubbs Hill. It takes about an hour to reach the top, where you get a great view of the city of Boise sprawling beneath you! Make sure to bring a hat for shade and plenty of water though.</p>
        <p><strong>Iron Creek Stanley Lake Trail to Sawtooth Lake</strong></p>
        <p>This 10-mile trail in the Sawtooth National Forest is great for a longer day hike, taking around 5 hours to get up to Sawtooth Lake and back. Though the terrain is a bit more challenging, the mountain views are worth it! The best time to hike this trail is in the summer and early autumn.</p>
        <p><strong>Goldbug Hot Springs</strong></p>
        <p>Goldbug Hot Springs is a beautiful hike near Salmon that is about 2 hours round trip, but considering the challenging steep portion right before the hot spring, why not bring a bathing suit so you can enjoy the plethora of hot and cold pools to relax you before heading back?</p>

      <h3>Essentials</h3>
      <p>
        <p><strong>Backpack</strong></p>
        <p>One of the most important things to have for a hike is a backpack. It is the simplest way to carry whatever gear you need. You can toss in snacks, your water bottle, a first aid kit for emergencies, and other things you believe to be essential to your enjoyment of the experience. Just don&rsquo;t carry too much or the weight will make your trip a lot more difficult.</p>
        <p><strong>Boots</strong></p>
        <p>A pair of good hiking boots will supply better support and protection for your feet as you&rsquo;re trekking along the trail. Also make sure to wear socks that will provide good cushioning, but are thin enough that you won&rsquo;t be sweating, which can increase the risk of blisters.</p>
        <p><strong>Other Gear</strong></p>
        <p>There are a lot of other things you can and should bring along on a hike to make it easier and more enjoyable. Hiking sticks can help you maintain stability and balance on more uneven trails, and they also make it easier on your body, reducing the stress on your legs by distributing the work across your whole body, since your arms are helping pull you onward with the help of the sticks. Many trails are well marked, but it&rsquo;s always good to have a map of the area and a compass so you don&rsquo;t get lost. Flashlights or headlamps for night hikes, or hats and sunglasses for sun protection during the day; there is so much you can bring, but it&rsquo;s really down to you to decide what you need to make your experience the best it can be!</p>
